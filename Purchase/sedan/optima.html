A plug-in hybrid variant was unveiled at the 2016 Chicago Auto Show. The Kia Optima PHEV shares the powertrain of the Hyundai Sonata PHEV, and like its sibling, it has a 9.8 kWh battery pack that delivers an all-electric range of 27 mi (43 km), but the Optima plug-in hybrid has a lower drag coefficient, which at 0.24 Cd is on par with the all-electric Tesla Model S. The Optima PHEV has an active grille, which automatically opens and closes at high and low speeds, contributing to reduce the Cd.[28] The plug-in hybrid features a 50 kW electric motor and 2.0-liter “Nu” four-cylinder GDI engine, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission.[
