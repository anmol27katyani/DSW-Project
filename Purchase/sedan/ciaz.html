       Maruti Suzuki finally tasted the success in the mid-size sedan segment with the Ciaz. Much of the credit of this success goes to the Ciazâ€™s sensible design which is in line with the expectations of target market. Interiors too are made up of quality materials and spacious rear seat has made Ciaz favourite among the chauffeur-driven owners. The boot of Maruti Ciaz is equally spacious and has been laid down without any significant intrusions from the suspension towers. A 1.4-liter petrol engine putting out 92PS/130Nm and a 1.3-litre diesel engine making 90PS /200 Nm drive the front wheels of the Ciaz via 5- speed manual transmission. The petrol variants come with the optional convenience of automatic gearbox to make the drive hassle-free for the city dwellers.
