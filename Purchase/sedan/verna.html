       Hyundai Verna is one of the most exquisitely styled C-segment sedans in India. Priced in the range of Rs 8.0-12.88 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), the Hyundai Verna is taking on the likes of Maruti Ciaz and Honda City. The design of new Verna is breathtakingly refresh and Hyundai has used amalgamation of soft elements and razor-sharp creases perfectly. The cabin comes with first-in-class ventilated front seats and the Vernaâ€™s equipment level is good enough to compete against the car a notch higher. 1.6-litre petrol and diesel engines making the output of 122 PS/ 151Nm and 127 PS/260Nm respectively powers the 2017 Verna and both these motors are mated to 6-speed manual transmission as well as automatic gearbox in both petrol and diesel guise. Hyundai is expecting a chunk of buyers to come to its fold with the launch of new generation Verna and the sales figures cues that the company has succeeded in the same.
