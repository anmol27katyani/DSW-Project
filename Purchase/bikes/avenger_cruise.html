    The Avenger Cruise 220 strictly focuses on its cruising abilities. The silencer is redesigned and looks similar to the one on the Street 150 and 220. However, the Cruise 220 is majorly finished in chrome. The bike gets loads of chrome treatment, sporting classic multi-spoke wheels. Handlebars are raised for relaxed highway cruising and its engine is shared with the Street 220 with liquid-cooling and chrome radiator. The bike can also be had with an optional windscreen to keep fatigue due to wind blasts under check. Also, the drive chain is claimed to be up to 20 per cent more durable than before.
