    2018 Kawasaki Ninja 250 was recently revealed internationally at Tokyo Motor Show. The updated motorcycle is exactly based on Ninja 400 and just uses a smaller power-plant under its fairing. The 249cc, twin cylinder engine on Ninja 250 is good for 39 HP at 12,500 rpm and 23.5 Nm at 10,000 rpm. This makes it almost similar in power when compared to Honda CBR250RR. 2018 Kawasaki Ninja 250 and 400 will collectively replace the aging Ninja 300, helping riders achieve the same sort of riding excitement from the smaller one and even more power on throttle from the 399 cc version. Kawasaki may enter local production for products like Ninja 250, Z250, Ninja 400, Z650 and Ninja 650 in India.
