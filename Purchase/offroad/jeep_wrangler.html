    The 2007 model year brought a complete redesign of the Jeep Wrangler, and also a four-door model. The TJ chassis was replaced by an all new JK platform. This next-generation Wrangler was noticeably wider than the previous model, with a 3.4-inch (86 mm) wider track; and though the two-door model has a 2-inch (51 mm) longer wheelbase, it is actually 2.5 inches (64 mm) shorter in overall length than the TJ, allowing for a 44.3째 approach angle and a 40.4째 departure angle.[27] With a larger factory available tire size of 32 inches, the breakover angle on the Rubicon is increased from 22.6째 to 25.4째
