	Shortly after the G63 AMG 6x6 sold out, Mercedes-Benz revealed a G500 4×4² bearing strong resemblance to the G63 AMG 6x6. It's one axle shorter than the G63 AMG 6x6 but uses a newly developed variable chassis, albeit with the body of the series production G-Class. The G500 4×4² is powered by the new 4.0 liter V8 biturbo engine which debuted in the Mercedes-AMG GT and later in the 2015 C63 AMG. It produces 422 hp and 610 Nm of torque which altogether is capable of achieving a 210 km/h top speed.
