    The twelfth generation F-150 was introduced for the 2009 model year as an update of the Ford full-size truck platform. Similar to its predecessor, these trucks are distinguished by their Super Duty-style grilles and head lamps; standard cab models again have two-doors instead of four. The FlareSide bed was continued until 2010, dropped along with the manual gearbox; outside of Mexico, the Lincoln Mark LT was replaced by the F-150 Platinum. A new model for 2010 included the SVT Raptor, a dedicated off-road pickup.
