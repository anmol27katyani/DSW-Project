       The undisputed king of SUV category is the Toyota Fortuner has maintained its considerable lead over the rivals like Ford Endeavour and Honda CR-V. The highlight of the Fortuner is its intimidating looks which are very well complemented by its large footprints. In fact, Toyota has been successful in achieving a very delicate balance between ruggedness and sophistication. Climb inside the huge cabin and brushed aluminium strips, faux wood and precise stitching offers a very cheery ambience inside. Under the hood, the Toyota has offered a new set of powertrains â€“ a 2.7-liter petrol and a 2.8-liter diesel motor putting out 165PS/245NM and 175PS/450NM, mated to both manual as well as automatic transmission, channelizing the powers either to the rear-wheel or all the four-wheel in diesel (depending on the variant selected) while in petrol only rear-wheel drive is available.
