The new Isuzu mu-X is a midsize SUV with an authoritative stance and size thatâ€™s sure to get attention while on the road. The mu-X is perfect and practical in the Philippines, as you can use it for a quick out of town trip and as a daily driven car with your family.

Built as a 7-seater, you can take your family and friends to an on and off the road escapade with the mu-X's impeccable smooth ride and a Terrain Command system (on 4x4 models) with a highly dependable under chassis. With a number of storage options, you're sure to have an ample space for your travel necessities and luggage. Passengers will also be entertained by a premium touchscreen head unit that is standard for the top-of-the-line variants.

Under the bonnet boasts a 2.5-L power plant that gives a healthy 136hp and 320Nm of torque mated to either a 5-speed manual or automatic gearbox. A new and more powerful 3.0 VGS engine is also available which can churn out 163 hp and 380 Nm of torque. Both are extremely dependable as they were designed with durability and fuel-efficiency as priorities.
