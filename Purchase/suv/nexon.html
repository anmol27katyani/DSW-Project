    Tata Motors is back in the groove with the launch of Nexon compact SUV. The Nexon is hogging all the limelight owing to its radical design and a lot of clever engineering touches. The white ceramic strip running along the windows is a clever visual touch and merges well with the other design elements like tear-drop headlamps, smiling grille, muscular bonnet etc. Step inside and the quality of the cabin is pretty impressive, especially in terms of choice of materials and their soft-touch feel. The Tata Nexon is powered by a set of new-age powertrains - 110PS/170Nm, 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol engine and 110PS/260Nm, 1.5-liter turbocharged diesel engine. For now, both these engines are mated to 6-speed manual transmission though AMT is soon expected to join the ranks
