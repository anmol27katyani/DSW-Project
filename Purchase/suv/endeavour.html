       Ford has successfully challenged the dominance of Toyota Fortuner with its Endeavour which is priced in the higher end of the spectrum. Retailed between Rs 25.09-31.4 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), the Endeavour now comes only in Automatic transmission as the manual variant of the SUV has now been discontinued. The 2.2-liter and 3.2-liter diesel engine under the bonnet are capable of mustering the motive force of 158PS/357Nm and 198PS/470Nm respectively. Further, the Ford also offers the Endeavour in both rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive version though the latter is available only in the top variant. The large footprints and intimidating presence of the Endeavour makes sure that you need not to honk for the way on the road. Interiors are well laid-out and functional though the sophistication does seem to be on lower levels compared to Toyota Fortuner and other premium SUVs
