       The EcoSport introduced Fordâ€™s new face in the country. The wide gaping grille with swept back headlamps stacked high up gives the EcoSport its SUV appeal. The flared wheel arches on the side profile and the raked windscreen make it look sporty. The kinetic design continues to the side-hinged tailgate. It looks busy in a way and the 200mm ground clearance gives it the SUV stance.

The interior is in black and grey and looks premium especially with the blue backlit buttons on the centre console. The dashboard is has its curves and blends with the overall design of the car. The twin pod instrument cluster reads out all the vital information including fuel economy, distance to empty, average speed et al along with the car and engine speeds. It gets automatic climate control for the top-spec variant along with height adjustable driving seats. The top-end trim gets six airbags for safety along with ABS while the mid variant gets dual front airbags and ABS.
