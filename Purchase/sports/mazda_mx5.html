The fourth generation MX-5 is 105 mm (4 inches) shorter and 100 kg (220 lb) lighter than its predecessor, putting the vehicle's curb weight near 1,000 kg (2,200 lb). Incorporating Mazda's SKYACTIV technology, the Miata is offered with a choice of two direct-injection petrol engines without turbo-chargers. The base model has a 1.5 L 96 kW (129 bhp) engine, and the North American (USA and Canada) version has a 2.0 L 116 kW (155 bhp) engine. [72]

The car was launched with both a six-speed manual shift transmission as well as a six-speed automatic transmission. The cockpit, steering wheel, and infotainment system are very similar to the 2014 Mazda3. The MX-5 is fitted as standard with a manually operated fabric roof that can be opened or closed within a few seconds.
