Subaru retails their version of the car as the Subaru BRZ. As a Toyota it is sold worldwide under different names with the most common being the Toyota 86—as used in Asia, Australia, North America (from August 2016), South Africa, and South America.[1] The name Toyota GT86 is used in Europe; both of the preceding names in New Zealand; and Toyota FT86 in Nicaragua and Jamaica. In the United States and Canada, the coupe previously sold as the Scion FR-S. After the Scion brand was discontinued in August 2016, the FR-S was renamed as the Toyota 86.
