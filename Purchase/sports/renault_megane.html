    The fourth generation MÃ©gane is larger and lower than its predecessor. The suspension is made of McPherson struts on the front and a torsion beam on the rear. Brakes are discs on both axles. The driver can select between five driving modes that change the car set up.

Most Megane's models have a head up display and a seven inch screen (replaced with a 8.7 inch touchscreen in some trim levels). Optionals include adaptive cruise control, automated emergency braking, lane departure warning, speed limit warning, blind spot monitoring, automatic headlights, reversing camera, parking sensors and a hands free parking system.
