    Subaru BRZ: it stands for Boxer, Rear-wheel drive, Zenith. No, that’s not a particularly dynamic name, which is a shame - because the car certainly is. Jointly developed with Toyota, the BRZ marks a break from tradition for four-wheel drive stalwarts Subaru. The BRZ instead boasts a lightweight rear-drive chassis, although it does use a Subaru-trademark flat-four engine mounted low in the front. So low, in fact, Subaru says the centre of gravity is lower than a Ferrari 458’s. 

Toyota may have done the design and the direct injection tech for the engine, but Subaru has done pretty much everything else. This is very much Subaru’s car, meaning the small coupe duo is most authentically replicated in BRZ guise. A brand new car built from scratch, it’s all been designed to maximise driver entertainment.
