The sixth generation Mustang was unveiled on December 5, 2013, in Dearborn, Michigan; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; Barcelona, Spain; Shanghai, China; and Sydney, Australia.[61] The internal project codename is S-550.[citation needed]

Changes include widened body by 1.5 inches, 1.4 inches lower body, trapezoidal grille, and a 2.75-inch lower decklid, as well as new colors. The passenger volume is increased to 84.5 cubic feet, and three engine options are available: a newly developed 2.3 L EcoBoost 310 hp four-cylinder introduced to reach high tariff global markets like China,[62] 3.7 L 300 hp V6,[63] or 5.0 L Coyote 435 hp V8, with either a Getrag six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters.

A new independent rear suspension (IRS) system was developed specifically for the new model.[67] It also became the first version factory designed as a right hand drive export model to be sold overseas through Ford new car dealerships in right hand drive markets.[citation needed] During this model year, left hand drive versions were expanded to new export markets.[citation needed]
